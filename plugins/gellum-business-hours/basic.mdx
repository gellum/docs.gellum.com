## Overview

Gellum Business Hours is a WooCommerce plugin that allows store owners to define their operating hours and manage their store's availability. This plugin helps you control when customers can place orders by:

- Setting specific business hours for each day of the week
- Disabling checkout functionality when the store is closed
- Displaying informative notices to customers about store status
- Providing a shortcode to show store status on any page

## Installation

1. Upload the `gellum-business-hours` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to **WooCommerce \> Business Hours** in your WordPress admin panel
4. Configure your store's operating hours for each day of the week
5. Save your settings

## Configuration

### Setting Up Business Hours

1. Go to **WooCommerce \> Business Hours** in your admin dashboard
2. For each day of the week, you can:
   - Set the status to **Open** or **Closed**
   - Define opening time (in 15-minute intervals)
   - Define closing time (in 15-minute intervals)
3. Click **Save changes** to apply your settings

### Overnight Hours

The plugin supports overnight business hours. If your store closes after midnight:

1. Set the opening time for the first day (e.g., Monday 22:00)
2. Set the closing time for the first day that is earlier than the opening time (e.g., 02:00)
3. The plugin will automatically recognize this as an overnight schedule

## Features

### Store Status Control

When the store is outside of business hours:

- The checkout functionality is disabled
- "Proceed to Checkout" buttons are hidden
- Informative notices are displayed on cart and checkout pages
- Customers are informed when the store will reopen

### Shortcode Usage

You can display the current store status anywhere on your site using the `[gellum_business_hours]` shortcode.

> **Note:** Prior to version 1.3.4, the shortcode was `[gellum_store_status]`. If you're upgrading from a previous version, you'll need to update any instances of the old shortcode.

#### Example Output:

- When open: `<span class="gellum-business-hours-status gellum-business-hours-open">Open</span>`
- When closing soon: `<span class="gellum-business-hours-status gellum-business-hours-open">Closing in 30 minutes</span>`
- When closed: `<span class="gellum-business-hours-status gellum-business-hours-closed">Closed. Next opening: Today at 9:00 am.</span>`

#### Shortcode Placement Options:

- In page or post content: `[gellum_business_hours]`
- In a text widget: `[gellum_business_hours]`
- In PHP template files: `<?php echo do_shortcode('[gellum_business_hours]'); ?>`

### Default Styling

The plugin comes with built-in CSS styles for the shortcode output. You can see the default styling below or override it with your own custom CSS:

```
/* Gellum Business Hours - Public Shortcode Styles [gellum_business_hours] */
.gellum-business-hours-status {
  /* Base class for all status indicators */
}

.gellum-business-hours-open {
  background-color: #E6FAF0; 
  color: #009879;
  padding: 5px 10px; 
  border-radius: 5px; 
  display: inline-block; 
  font-size: 0.9em;
}

.gellum-business-hours-closed {
  background-color: #F8D7DA; 
  color: #DC3545;
  padding: 5px 10px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 0.9em;
}
```

## Technical Details

### Requirements

- WordPress 5.0 or higher

## Troubleshooting

### Store Status Is Incorrect

If your store status doesn't match your expectations:

3. Remember that overnight schedules require the closing time to be earlier than the opening time
